    applicantSampleAnswer: "I am Krish Sharma, a developer focused on modern web applications. Over the past year, I have built several projects using React, HTML5, and JavaScript. I work primarily with functional components, useState, and useEffect, and I prioritize building responsive, accessible web interfaces.",
    score: 8.5,
    feedback: "Good introduction and clear tone. Could be strengthened by highlighting quantifiable impact and state management examples."

    aiSpeech: "Now dive into React's core mechanics. Explain what the Virtual DOM is and how the diffing and reconciliation algorithm updates the actual DOM.",
    applicantSampleAnswer: "The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM tree. When component state changes, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree and compares it with the previous one using its diffing algorithm. It calculates the minimal set of changes needed and batches them into the real DOM efficiently.",
    score: 8.8,
    feedback: "Strong technical explanation of the reconciliation cycle with accurate terminology."
  },

    aiSpeech: "Next question: Explain how a RESTful API works, and tell me the specific HTTP status codes you would return for invalid request payloads versus missing authentication credentials.",
    applicantSampleAnswer: "REST stands for Representational State Transfer and relies on stateless client-server communication using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. For validation errors or malformed input, I return a 400 Bad Request or 422 Unprocessable Entity. For missing or invalid credentials, I return 401 Unauthorized.",

    aiSpeech: "Moving on to backend runtimes: How does Node.js handle asynchronous operations without getting blocked on single-threaded execution?",
    applicantSampleAnswer: "Node.js executes single-threaded JavaScript code via the V8 engine, but utilizes libuv and the event loop with worker thread pools to offload asynchronous I/O tasks like file access or database queries. Using async/await and Promises lets us write clean non-blocking code.",

    applicantSampleAnswer: "In an e-commerce cart prototype, items were occasionally duplicating upon rapid checkout clicks. I inspected the Network tab and console logs in Chrome DevTools. I discovered the submit button wasn't disabled during network transit, triggering concurrent POST requests. I implemented a debounced handler and disabled state flag.",
